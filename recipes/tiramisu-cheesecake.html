        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a pan of water on the lowest oven rack.</li>
            <li>To make the crust: Crush ladyfingers into fine crumbs. Place crumbs into a bowl with melted butter and coffee-flavored liqueur; <br>stir until evenly combined. Press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>To make the filling: Beat cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. <br> Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix in coffee-flavored liqueur. Add flour and eggs; mix on low speed just until smooth. If batter seems too thick, mix in heavy cream. Pour batter over the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until just set, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Open the oven door, turn off the heat, and leave cheesecake to cool on the center rack for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Just before serving, grate semisweet chocolate over the top.</li>
